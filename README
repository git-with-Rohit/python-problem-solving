# LeetCode Python Solutions

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.x-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Python. Each solution is organized into its own directory and includes a description of the problem, the solution, and tests to verify the solution.

## Problem List
- [Problem 1: Test](./problem1_test_sum)
- [Problem 2: Two Sum](./prob2_two_sum)
- ... (Add more problems )

## Structure
Each problem directory contains the following files:
- `README.md`: Description of the problem, approach, examples, and constraints.
- `solution.py`: The Python solution for the problem.
- `tests.py`: Unit tests for the solution.

## Example
### Problem 2: Add Two Numbers
#### Problem Statement
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

#### Approach
- Traverse both linked lists and add corresponding digits.
- Use a carry to handle sums greater than 10.
- Continue until both linked lists and carry are processed.


#### Solution
See `solution.py` for the implementation.

## Running Tests
To run the tests for any problem, navigate to the problem directory and run the `tests.py` file.
